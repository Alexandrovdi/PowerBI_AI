# Challenge 2 - Working with Data in Power BI

## Prerequisites

1. [Step 1 - Setup](https://github.com/Alexandrovdi/PowerBI_AI/blob/main/Challenge%20steps/Step%201%20-%20Setup.md) should be done successfully.


## Introduction

The purpose of this challenge is to introduce the participants to working with Power BI Dataflows which will be used in challenges 2 - 4, and visualizing data with Power BI which will demonstrate the prepared data.


## Basic Steps to complete
1. Login to www.powerbi.com and create a new workspace
1. In your workspace create a new "Dataflow"
1. Enter connection details for the database you restored in Step 1
1. Select the Products and Customers views, and the FactInternetSales and DimDate tables
1. Select Transform data
1. Save and refresh the dataflow
1. Launch Power BI Desktop and start the "Get Data" process
1. Naviagite to the Power BI Dataflows data source
1. Select the objects created in step one
1. Build reports with the loaded data

## Potential pitfalls

1. Dataflows only are avaialble in workspaces, so a user has to create a workspace first.
1. App workspaces are only avaialble to Pro Users, so if the user doesn't have a pro license they must sign up for a 60 day pro trial.
1. If the users is working with a new account for this it is possible that there is a conflict between the credentials in Power BI desktop and the Power BI dataflow.  You may need to clear Power BI's credential cache.
